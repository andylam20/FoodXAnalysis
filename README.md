## EDA Findings and Observations
### Distribution of Items Bought in the Data Set
![Menu_Item_Order_Freq](https://github.com/andylam20/FoodXAnalysis/assets/105662876/bf9a6b9d-7c15-43ec-887c-534095641646)
We can see from the graph that every item has a roughly equal amount of orders in the data set meaning that if we blindly guess what the person wanted, then we would have roughly a 10% chance of guessing correctly.
