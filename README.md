## EDA Findings and Observations
### Distribution of Items Bought in the Data Set
#### Inital Hypothesis

From the graph, it's evident that each item in the dataset has a nearly equal distribution of orders. This suggests that if we were to make random guesses about what the person ordered, we would have approximately a 10% chance of guessing correctly.

#### Most Common Items Order per Time
One initial intuition for which feature might be helpful is time. This is because each food item is usually craved more depending on the time. For example, a bowl of cereal is generally more eaten in the morning.

Based on the graph, we can see that there are general trends in which foods are more likely to be bought throughout the day. We can see that the Breaded Pork Tenderloin Sandwich, Cornbread Hush Puppies, and Fried Catfish are more likely to be bought from opening hours to hour 10 and continue to be popular till noon. Around noon, other items such as Indiana Corn on the Cob and Indiana Pork Chilli tend to also be extremely popular item choices before falling off around hour 13. This is when other items such as Hoosier BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich, Indiana Buffalo Chicken Tacos, and Ultimate Grilled Cheese Sandwich are highly purchased.
